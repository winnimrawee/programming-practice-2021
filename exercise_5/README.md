# Exercise 5 - Playing with networks

Task 1 - Create a peer to peer network (P2P) in which each node is both a server and a client. The size of the network is N = 20. Make sure each node only has N/2 or less connections.

Task 2 - Broadcast a message from one node. Make sure that the broadcasted message is not repeated for the nodes who already received the message.
