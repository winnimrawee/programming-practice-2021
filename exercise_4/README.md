# Exercise 4 - Playing with optimisations

Task 1 - Create a new objective function. Modify the DE class to pass it as parameter to the DE.

2 - Find a harder objective function which is not solved by DE (DE cannot reach the optimum in 1000 generations with 100 individuals). Implement other optimization algorithm that can have better solutions than DE. Make your point by comparing the average over 30 trials of both algorithms.

3 - Plot a graph with all visited candidate solutions. To be able to visualize use problems with 2 dimensions and 3 dimensions (`number_of_variables = 2` or `number_of_variables = 3`).
